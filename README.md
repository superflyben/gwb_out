# Description
This code will parse GWB output text files and store the results in Matlab cell arrays where they can be more easily manipulated within Matlab. The main benefit is the ability to extract results from multiple runs and show the output on a single plot. The code is fairly well documented, so syntax for running it is left to the user.
